A supply chain analytics project to optimise the transportation of perishable raw materials from production facilities in mainland Europe to processing plants in the UK, and thereafter to storage and distribution centres across UK.


A Supply Chain Company (SCC) is importing perishable fruit as the raw material, for production of finished goods 
through processing. The company has its main plant located 10 miles away from Tilbury docks (United Kingdom). 
The project was to optimise their business operations.
